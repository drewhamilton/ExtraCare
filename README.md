# Extra Care
![](https://github.com/drewhamilton/ExtraCare/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

> Using Kotlin types whose properties will change over time in public API requires extra care to
> maintain source and binary compatibility as well as an idiomatic API for each language.

â€” Jake Wharton,
  [Public API challenges in Kotlin](https://jakewharton.com/public-api-challenges-in-kotlin/)

Extra Care is a Kotlin compiler plugin that makes writing and maintaining data classes for public
APIs easy. Like with normal Kotlin data classes, all you have to do is provide members in your
class's constructor. Then give it the `@DataApi` annotation and enjoy the generated `toString`,
`equals`, and `hashCode`. (Builder class for Java consumers and DSL initializer for Kotlin consumers
to be added.)

Extra Care is a work in progress.

## Use
Mark your class as a `@DataApi class` instead of a `data class`:
```kotlin
@DataApi class Simple(
    val int: Int,
    val requiredString: String,
    val optionalString: String?
)
```

And enjoy the benefits of a readable `toString` and working `equals` and `hashCode`. Unlike normal
data classes, no `copy` or `componentN` functions are generated.

Extra Care is available on Maven Central. It is experimental, and the API may undergo breaking
changes before version 1.0.0. Kotlin Compiler plugins in general are experimental and new versions
of Kotlin might break something in this compiler plugin.

Snapshots of the development version are available in [Sonatype's Snapshots
repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/#view-repositories;snapshots~browsestorage).

To use Extra Care, include the following in your Gradle dependencies:
```groovy
// Usually top-level:
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        classpath "dev.drewhamilton.extracare:extracare-gradle-plugin:$version"
    }
}

// Per module:
apply plugin: 'dev.drewhamilton.extracare'
```

## To-do
* Generate the inner Builder class
* Propagate the constructor default values to the Builder 
* Mark the constructor as private
* Generate the top-level DSL initializer
* Add robust testing
* Add robust compiler messages for unsupported cases
* Write an IDE plugin?
* Multiplatform support?
